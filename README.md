# Sahayak - A helping hand - The User Module

This mobile application is developed to serve as a helping hand to the visually impaired. This is intended to assist them in public transport by identifying the bus they want to get into, and also by notifying them when the destination is reached.

## Getting Started

The way the app works is, input your destination as a voice command to the app, and let the app search the nearest bus heading to your destination for you. It will give you arrival predictions as well, with respect to the position of the bus. 

Google Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs are used for the purpose, along with the co-ordinates of the buses supplied from the MySQL database.

### Setting up the Back-end

To get the back-end for the app working, install apache server with PHP and MySQL. Then the PHP scripts are good to run.
[Coming Soon - Back-end files written in PHP]
